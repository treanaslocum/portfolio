        I'm a creative thinker by nature. As a child I would take things apart, figure out how they worked, and put them back together. It is that childlike curiosity about how the world works that led me to not only become a published author, but a product designer, and web developer as well.

      </p>
      <p class="text-4xl leading-normal mt-12">I turn ideas or raw creativity into things, products, and works of art that people not only love but get functional use out of.</p>

      <p class="text-4xl leading-normal">
        It is the above notion that led me to offer my gifts of writing, design, and engineering to the world. It brings me no greater joy than to help others bring their creative ideas and dreams to life.

        I'm a relentless creative and problem solver.The skills that I possess today were forged in the fires of hard work, determination, and perseverance. Anything I needed to learn I showed great initiative and grit and taught myself.
      </p>
      <p class="text-4xl mt-12 leading-normal">That willingness to sit there, study, and learn anything is one of my greatest strengths.</p>
      <p class="text-4xl mt-12 leading-normal">On projects, unexpected things will pop up and you want a designer, writer or engineer that can research a solution, implement it and deliver to you the best result possible in a timely fashion.</p>
